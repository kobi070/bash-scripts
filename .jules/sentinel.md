## 2025-05-14 - Leakage of API Keys in Verbose Logs
**Vulnerability:** Use of `curl -v` with sensitive headers (`X-JFrog-Art-Api: $JFROG_API_KEY`) exposes the API key in the standard error output.
**Learning:** Verbose output in `curl` includes request headers. If these headers contain secrets, they will be printed to logs, which is a security risk in CI/CD environments or shared systems.
**Prevention:** Avoid using verbose mode (`-v`, `--verbose`) in production scripts when handling secrets. Use specific `curl` options to debug if needed, or rely on exit codes and structured error messages.
